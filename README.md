# Some simulations using the Finite Element Method

Just an assortment of scripts I've made to learn about the finite element method. Perpetually a work in progress.

Currently mesh files are created using external programs.
For 2D the program  used is [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html). 3D Matlab/Octave mesh files are generated using [Gmsh](
https://gmsh.info/).
